    Called every frame, passing in `dt` since the last frame. `dt`
    is short for `deltaTime` and is measured in seconds. Multiplying
    this by any changes we wish to make in our game will allow our
    game to perform consistently across all hardware; otherwise, any

    things to happen right away, just once, like when we want to quit.
